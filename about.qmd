**Cracking Data** is all about my love for experimenting with data. It's a collection of articles which help explain awesome tools, concepts, and projects through the context of disciplines that I am passionate about like art and martial arts!

Who am I? I’m a data science Master’s student who's interested in AI, deep learning, and explainable data science. I aim to keep my work fun and informative so others might be inspired to share their own experiments.
