**Cracking Data** is all about my love for experimenting with data. It's a collection of written projects which help explain awesome data tools and concepts disciplines that I am passionate about like art!

Who am I? Iâ€™m a data science Master's student at the [Institute for Advanced Analytics](https://analytics.ncsu.edu/?page_id=243) who's interested in AI, deep learning, and explainable data science. I aim to keep my work fun and informative so others might be inspired to share their own experiments. 

To give feedback, ask questions, or share funny stories you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/yangrchen) or email [rchen28@ncsu.edu](mailto:rchen28@ncsu.edu).
